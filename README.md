# Smoke and Regression Testing — Urban Routes Web App
### Project Overview

This project focused on executing manual test cases, smoke testing, and regression testing for the Urban Routes web application, with structured bug reporting compiled in checklists and reports.

Urban Routes is a web-based platform that generates travel routes and calculates estimated time and cost across different transportation methods.

## Objective

Validate the stability of core features after updates and identify defects that could negatively impact user experience, system reliability, and release quality.
The goal was to detect issues early, reduce production risk, and support release decisions based on product quality.

### Test Scope

**Smoke and regression tests were performed to ensure that critical functionalities remained stable after updates.
Main flows tested included:**

- Route creation
- Transport selection
- Travel time and cost calculation
- General navigation and usability

All tests followed previously designed **[test case](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zi541z3FCGLh491Zt3OTMLlJoa2S7_IwYySQ6Jqrrw8/edit?gid=1554413997#gid=1554413997)** used to guide execution and validation.

## Test Environment
```
Application: Urban Routes (Web)

Browser: Google Chrome

Operating System: Windows 11

Testing type: Manual testing
```
## Tools and Skills Applied

Manual Testing | Test Cases | Checklists | Bug Reporting | Regression Testing | Smoke Testing | Excel

## Test Execution
Here it is possible to follow demonstrations from the test cases, title development, agile methodology, and how to define priorities.
In the video, more is explained about the test cases and how they may or may not affect the app release.

## Results

Regression testing identified **7 Medium/low-severity defects**.
Although these issues did not block core functionality, they affected usability and visual consistency and required correction to maintain quality standards before release.

All defects were documented and organized in a checklist to ensure traceability and visibility for the development team.
 
## Business Impact

The testing process improved product reliability and supported informed release decisions.
Early detection of defects helps:

- Prevent negative user feedback and poor reviews

- Reduce risk of production issues after deployment

- Maintain product credibility and user trust

- Ensure consistent performance across different devices and environments

- Quality assurance activities contributed directly to risk reduction and product stability.

## Conclusion

Smoke and regression testing enabled clear identification of system weaknesses and ensured that core functionalities remained stable after updates.
Structured testing, documentation, and defect reporting strengthened quality control and reinforced QA as a key factor in delivering a reliable and competitive product.# Regression-Test---Smoke-Test---Urban-Routes-App
